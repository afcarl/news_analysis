#Source validation

The idea here is to validate news stories through a web of trust.  If the article sources trusted sources, it is given a trusted score and a classification is decided as to whether it is trusted or not.

Tools for NLP:
	* nltk
	* spacy
	* textacy
	* vader
	* sentlex
	* stanford coreNLP

We could use structure of the page for a feature

Check for conflict of interest

Bias:
author bias: did they come down for or against this topic in the past.
website bias: does the website have many pro or con for the article

Can we decide ground truth from the world (the internet)?

Big win:
Given an authoratitative source, can we decide whether or not a given article comforms or goes against that authoraitative source?

Smaller win:
Equivalence classes is also a win.
